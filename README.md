# Overview

As a software engineer, I am always striving to further my learning and skills by working on practical applications. This note-taking application is a demonstration of my proficiency in the TypeScript programming language, as well as my ability to integrate various technologies to build a functional, full-stack application.

The purpose of this software is to create a simple yet effective note-taking application where users can add, update, delete, and view notes. This project not only showcases the use of TypeScript but also demonstrates my ability to set up a backend server with Express, connect to a MongoDB database, and create a user-friendly frontend interface. By working on this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of TypeScript's syntax, asynchronous functions, and integration with other technologies like Express and MongoDB.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:
- **Visual Studio Code**: As my primary code editor.
- **Node.js**: For running the backend server.
- **npm**: For managing project dependencies.
- **MongoDB**: As the database for storing notes.
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints.

The programming languages and libraries used in this project include:
- **TypeScript**: The main programming language used to write the application.
- **Express**: A Node.js web application framework used to build the backend server.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **ESLint**: For linting TypeScript code to ensure code quality.
- **Jest**: For writing and running tests to verify the functionality of the application.
- **Supertest**: For testing HTTP endpoints.

# Future Work

There are several improvements and features I plan to add to this application in the future:
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own set of notes.
- **Search Functionality**: Enhance the search functionality to allow users to search notes by title or content.
- **Tags and Categories**: Add the ability for users to organize notes with tags and categories.
- **Responsive Design**: Improve the frontend to be fully responsive and provide a better user experience on mobile devices.
